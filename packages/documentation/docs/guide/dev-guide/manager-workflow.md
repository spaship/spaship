## SPAship Manager - A New Way to managing your SPAs ðŸ™Œ

### **What is SPAship Manager?**

SPAship Manager is an easy to use web application (GUI) to manage a group of SPA's from a single place, and you can accelerate your deployment time.Â 

SPAshipÂ Manager is a front-end app (web application) that comes under SPAship, and communicates with  Orchestrator for managing and deploying SPAs (Single Page Applications). We have developed this application which will not only provide you the deployment features, also provide you the **real-time** updates and **analytics** for better managing your SPAs. 

We can add web Property to SPAship Manager. It is nothing but a group of related SPAs.
