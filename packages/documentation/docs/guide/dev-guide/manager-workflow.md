## SPAShip Manager - A New Way to managing your SPAs ðŸ™Œ

### **What is SPAShip Manager?**

SPAShip Manager is a platform that will help you to deploy and manage your SPA's in a single place, and you can accelerate your deployment time.Â 

SPAShipÂ Manager is a new product (web application) that comes under SPAShip, and communicates with SPAShip Operator for managing and deploying SPAs (Single Page Applications). We have developed this application which will not only provide you the deployment features, also provide you the **real-time** updates and **analytics** for better managing your SPAs. SPAShip manager also overcomes many deployment-related problems.

### **Key Features of SPAShip manager:**
- Fewer clicks for SPA deployment
- Add as many websites (properties) as you wantÂ 
- Versioning for the Website along with the SPAs
- Add flat and multiple repositories for your website
- Real-time alerts of SPA deploymentÂ in the activity stream
- Manage all the deployed SPAs and multiple websites in a single place
- Dashboard for all the deployment metrics based on website, SPA, and activity status
- No Code & Command for Deployment (CI-CD integration with Gitlab and Github, which will automatically deploy the SPAs)
