# SPAship API

REST API for deploying SPAs to the SPAship platform.

## Global install

```
npm install -g @spaship/api
spaship-api
```

## Hacking

```
git@github.com:spaship/api.git
npm install
```

From here, you can `npm start` to launch the service, or `npm run dev` to launch the service with auto-restart when source files are changed.

## Testing

| Command               | Purpose                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `npm test`            | Run tests.                                    |
| `npm test -- --watch` | Run tests, and re-run them when files change. |

### Pull requests and commit messages

This repo follows Conventional Commits, a standard format for writing commit messages. Each commit message becomes an entry in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md), and the commit messages are also used to determine what version bump to apply.

Read more about [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) for a description and examples!

If you are working on a pull request, don't worry about commit message format. Commit early and often.

When your pull request is merged, "squash and merge" should be used, and a Conventional Commit message written at that point. In this way, your pull request will become a single commit in the master branch and one entry in the CHANGELOG will be created.

## Configuration

Configuration can be provided by CLI flags, environment variables, or a configuration file. Arguments are processed in that order, so CLI flags take precedence over environment variables, which take precedence over the configuration file.

**Note:** the filepath configurations (`config file`, `upload dir`, and `webroot`) must be absolute paths when defined in an environment variable or config file. When defined in CLI options like, they can be written relative to CWD. Example: `--config-file=../config.json`.

**Note:** When `mock_db` is on, the mocked database will be persisted as a flat file named `mock-db.js` right here in the same directory as this README.

## SPA metadata

Each deployed SPA gets a hidden directory inside `webroot` which houses two files that contain some SPA metadata, `ref` and `name`.

For example, a SPA deployed with name "My App", path `/my-app`, and ref `v1.0.0` would result in a webroot that looks like this:

```
www
├── .my-app
│   ├── name
│   └── ref
└── my-app
    └── index.html
```

## API

### /deploy

Deploy a SPA to SPAship. A very simple Web UI is provided, or the deployment can be automated with an HTTP request.

#### With cURL

```
NAME="My Awesome Application"
SPA_PATH="/my-app"
REF="v1.0.0"
curl -v -F upload=@test.zip -F name="$NAME" -F path="$SPA_PATH" -F ref="$REF" localhost:8008/deploy
```

Change `localhost:8008` to the host and port the service is running on. Change `APP_NAME` to your preferred app name, and `test.zip` to the archive you want to upload.

#### With the web UI

When you run the deployment service, it will print something like:

`Listening on http://localhost:8008`

Open that URL in a browser and you'll see a form for uploading apps.

### /list

Returns a list of all deployed SPAs. If they have a metadata directory, that metadata will be included.

Here's an example response from `/list`. Two apps are listed in the example, "SPAnom" has metadata and "SPAnonymous" does not.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "SPAnominal",
    "path": "/spanominal",
    "ref": "v1.0.0"
  },
  {
    "name": null,
    "path": "/spanonymous",
    "ref": null
  }
]
```

A few notes about the response.

- `path` is not stored in the metadata directory; it's inferred from the SPA's directory in the webroot.
- The "SPAnonymous" app has `null` values for name and ref because it was not deployed with `/deploy`, but it's included so that `/list` provides a complete report of what paths are being made available.

| HTTP Method | Endpoint                     | Description                                                                                                                                              |

| `POST`      | `/apikey`                    | Creates and returns an API key object such as `{ key: "ABCD" }`. It expects the body of the request body to contain an user id as `{ user: "babyyoda" }` |

| `GET`       | `/user?hashedKey=e12e115a`   | Returns an API key object such as `{ user: "babyyoda" }`                                                                                                 |
| `DELETE`    | `/user?user=babyyoda`        | Deletes all API keys for user `babyyoda`                                                                                                                 |
